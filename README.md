# 2D Graphics WinForms Application

This is an application that allows you to create points on a canvas and connect 
them with a variety of line types. You can also easily adjust the color and thickness
of the lines, fill the space between them and move points in different directions,
that creates the perfect and absolutely astonishing graphics.

 GUI of the application is relatively simple and has the russian localization, 
 therefore I'll explain only some of not so obvious features:

- by clicking on a point and moving the mouse you can change the position of the point 
- by clicking ```ESC``` key you can clean the canvas
- by clicking ```SPACE``` tab you can make points move and stop
- to shift the currently editing figure, use ```↓, →, ←, ↑``` keys
- in a moving mode, press ```+``` or ```-``` keys to adjust the speed of movement
